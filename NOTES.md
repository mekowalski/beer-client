# App Ideas
- I'm thinking maybe I could make this app in a similar style from my previous apps of `Song App`, `Book App` or `Blog App`
- The layout could also be similar, given a list of beers on one side, with beer details on the other side
- I can request info/data from the Rails API(build actions, action creators, reducers and store)
- Not certain how to get the data and modify it if necessary, that may be for later
- Literally using and external API(rails part), requesting data from the react/redux side then displaying it
- I've done this probably 4-5 separate times!!!
